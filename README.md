# Hello!

I'm @SaiKiru.

I'm a student and hobbyist programmer interested in creating software for Linux and Android. I'm not as active as I used to be but I still do program in my spare time.

I'm currently learning C and Vala as I hope to contribute to the development of software for Linux.
I like promoting the notion of open-source programs and I hope Linux will one day surpass other OS in the number of users.

I'm looking to collaborate on some cool software in Linux. I'm looking at those built in Python, Java, C, Vala or even GDScript.
Perhaps one day I'll have a green calendar, if you know what I mean.

It's nice to meet you and I wish you luck on your journey!
