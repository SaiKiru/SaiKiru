# Hello!

I'm Anthony Aromin.

I'm a student and hobbyist programmer interested in creating software for Linux and Android. I'm not as active as I used to be but I still do program in my spare time.

My skills include Java, Python, C++, GDScript and Android. Do ping me if you need help with something and I'll see what I can do in my spare time.
