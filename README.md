# Hello!

I'm Anthony Aromin.

I'm a student and hobbyist programmer interested in creating software for Linux and Android. I'm not as active as I used to be but I still do program in my spare time.

__Languages:__
- Java
- Python
- C++
- GDScript
- Kotlin
- Bash

Do ping me if you need help with something and I'll see what I can do in my spare time.
